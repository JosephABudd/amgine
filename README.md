This library might be finished.

amgine is a poly numberic substituion cypher. ( Similar to the poly alphabetic substition cyphers children create in grade school for passing secret messages around. )

This project is how I am learning zig and making a zig library. This library is working but I have not tested and used the marshalling.

I got this library to work in a zig application folder's libs/ folder so now I'm trying to use the lib with zigmod and zigmod fetch.

[The **Men** and **Women** at the zig discord server](https://discord.gg/zig) have gotten me over most of my mental hurdles with their help. Now I'm thinking the Zig way and I'm really liking Zig.
